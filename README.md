# AutoIntelligentDripIrrigationSystem

The auto intelligent drip irrigation system using Arduino Uno, FC-28 soil moisture sensor, 5V relay module, and LCD screen solves the problem of inaccurate and wasteful water usage in traditional farming methods. In the past, farmers would water their crops based on a set schedule rather than based on the actual needs of the plants. This approach is inefficient and can result in plants either receiving too little or too much water. This can lead to a host of problems, including stunted growth, decreased yield, and even the death of the plants.

The auto intelligent drip irrigation system provides a solution to this problem by automating the irrigation process and using a moisture sensor to accurately determine the moisture needs of the plants. The moisture sensor measures the level of moisture in the soil, and when it falls below a certain level, the system activates the 5V relay module, which turns on the water supply. The amount of water supplied can be adjusted according to the moisture requirements of the crops and the different types of drips can be used for different crops depending on their water needs.

This system provides an efficient and sustainable way to irrigate crops, as it uses only the necessary amount of water required by the plants, minimizing waste and conserving water resources. In addition, the automated system eliminates the need for manual watering, reducing labor costs and increasing efficiency.

Moreover, this system can be customized to fit the specific needs of each crop, ensuring optimal growth and yield. By adjusting the moisture levels according to the plant's requirements, the system can ensure that the plants receive the right amount of water at the right time. This can lead to increased crop yields and improved plant health, resulting in better quality produce.

The system is also scalable and can be used in a variety of farming contexts, from small-scale home gardens to large-scale commercial operations. By utilizing technology to optimize water usage, farmers can reduce their environmental impact and promote sustainable farming practices.

In summary, the auto intelligent drip irrigation system using Arduino Uno, FC-28 soil moisture sensor, 5V relay module, and LCD screen solves the problem of inaccurate and wasteful water usage in traditional farming methods. It provides an efficient and sustainable way to irrigate crops, while also reducing labor costs and increasing efficiency. By customizing the system to fit the specific needs of each crop, farmers can optimize plant growth and yield, while also conserving water resources and promoting sustainable farming practices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
range of soil moisture sensor is -> 0 to 1023 || high value = less moisture and vice versa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
value can be set according to the moisture level required by the crop (a crop can require more water so we can set the value accordinly so that the crop gets the required amount of water)
